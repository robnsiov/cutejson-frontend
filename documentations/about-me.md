# [About Me](#about-me)

My name is **Mohammadreza**, but I go by **Robnsiov**. You can find me on **[LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/mohammad-reza-zolfaghari-8a9148224)**, **[GitHub](https://github.com/robnsiov)**, **[Telegram](https://t.me/robnsiov)**, and other platforms under this tag.

The story begins **seven days** before the start of the year **1403** (Persian calendar). It was an ordinary day like any other. I had just dressed to go out, and as I was heading upstairs to place something there before leaving, I suddenly **slipped** on the stairs. I fell, and my **left arm** hit the edge of the step so hard that I knew something was wrong. Moments later, I was sitting on the stairs, holding my left arm tightly due to the intense pain. I realized it was broken. I called my **mom** immediately, and we rushed to the hospital.

At the emergency room, the doctor confirmed that my left arm was **completely broken**. I was devastated. Programming is my life, and I do everything with my **hands**. How was I going to **work** now? They sent us to get my arm casted, but we had no experience, so we didn't know what kind of cast would be best. They applied a very heavy and poorly made cast, making my hand even more swollen and painful. I could barely sleep or move due to the pain, and the painkillers weren't helping much. **Every night**, I wished that fall had never happened.

Two days later, we returned to the doctor, and he immediately said that my arm needed surgery. This news actually gave me some relief, knowing that surgery might fix it. With only two days left in the year, the doctor advised me to get the surgery done **quickly** since most doctors would be on holiday for the New Year. My mom and I decided to go ahead with the surgery.

After the surgery, I spent a night in the hospital, and the doctor told me the operation went **well**. He had placed a metal plate in my arm and repaired the nerves so I could move my hand later. I am incredibly grateful to **Dr. Khazaei** for giving me a **new chance** at life.

Now, five months after the surgery, my arm will never be the same, but I'm back to programming and living my life. I can't lift heavy objects or put too much pressure on my arm, but this experience **changed me**. It made me realize that I want to use all my energy and skills to help others.

I'm not a doctor, but as a **programmer**, I will contribute to society by providing free and open resources for as long as I live. This project was created with the intention of giving back and helping others. **With love**.
